## Choices explanation

### Stack

The project has been bootstrapped with Next.js, then converted to typescript.
For code quality, I used commit-lint with husky, and eslint (for formatting too - usually prettier is my choice for that).
Everything has been kept as close to the default settings as possible to avoid time consumption.
Since the project's focus was not on UI, I decided to try Tailwind CSS, but I spent a short time on that.

I chose Next.js over other frameworks mainly to have routing out of the box, and because I'm more confident with it.
